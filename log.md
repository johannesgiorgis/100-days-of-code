# 100 Days Of Data Science - Log 01

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Tuesday, February 11, 2020.

### Day 1: Tuesday, February 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I had jumped through the relevant backend aspects of the course to help me complete an API coding challenge. Now I wanted to go through the rest and build out the PyPI Clone that we build throughout the course.

**Thoughts**: I got to the point where I have a common layout for my two page website - home page and about page. So far, we utilized Flask, HTML, Jinja templates, CSS and JavaScript via Bootstrap.

**Link(s) to work**: [Initial Website with Common Layout](https://github.com/johannesgiorgis/talkpython/tree/21be4881090575df20168e649068b741c4297357/data-driven-web-apps-with-flask/pypi_org)


### Day 2: Wednesday, February 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I completed the _Jinja2 templates_, _Routing and URLs_, _Bootstrap and frontend CSS framework_ chapters and starting working on the _Adding our design_ chapter. I spent most of my day working through the course so this was more than 1 hour worth of work.

**Thoughts**: Learning about Michael's approach to organizing his code is interesting - he is very organized and has come up with an approach that works well for him. It's great to learn how to structure Flask Apps to allow you to grow them over time instead of the typical stuff you find in most Flask tutorials.

### Day 3: Thursday, February 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I completed the _Adding Our Design_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: Front-end and Design work is so not my forte - it took much longer than I expected to get everything working as in the class chapter. But it worked and it was great seeing the processing of going from plain vanilla HTML to a fully designed set of pages.

**Link(s) to work**: [Completed Initial Design work](https://github.com/johannesgiorgis/talkpython/tree/973d6760a8860d2a0509ca14d5a9e462c52969c9/data-driven-web-apps-with-flask/pypi_org)


### Day 4: Friday, February 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I completed the _Moddeling data with SQLAlchemy classes_ chapter and started working on the _Using SQLAlchemy_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: It was fun to be back at the back end :) Working with SQLAlchemy is very interesting. These chapters I had jumped through before so it served as a good revision.

**Link(s) to work**: [Basic Insert Script Completed](https://github.com/johannesgiorgis/talkpython/tree/ca02f26ec0e72f52fa5611cc2318983b767b09be/data-driven-web-apps-with-flask/pypi_org)


### Day 5: Saturday, February 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I worked on the _Using SQLAlchemy_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: Today was not as productive as previous days. Got halfway through the _Using SQLAlchemy_ course where we started to crease the helper functions to load data into our database as well as getting the python packages data.

**Link(s) to work**: [Started using SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/johannesgiorgis/talkpython/tree/2ebe52c3ba05b93f95ca5d4738fb4ff1175a9096/data-driven-web-apps-with-flask)


### Day 6: Friday, February 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I completed the _Using SQLAlchemy_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: This past week saw me travel back and start my new job and I ended up not working on this until the end of the week. I completed Chapter 9, _Using SQLAlchemy_ which was interesting. I need to wrap my head around relationships and querying them in SQLAlechmy. Tomorrow, I jump to doing Database migrations with Alembic so I'm excited to learn more about that.

**Link(s) to work**: [Completed using SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/johannesgiorgis/talkpython/tree/5477e33ad2686520a5d307ebc4a9b1feed3167c0/data-driven-web-apps-with-flask)


### Day 7: Saturday, February 22nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I completed the _Database Migrations with Alembic_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: Learning how you could evolve your Relational Database without touching any SQL code is very cool! I look forward to incorporating Alembic along with SQLAlechmy in my future projects.

**Link(s) to work**: [Completed Database Migrations with Alembic](https://github.com/johannesgiorgis/talkpython/tree/c666167da58ee426aedd0eafb89ea51411496e7c/data-driven-web-apps-with-flask)


### Day 8: Sunday, February 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I got half way through the _User input and HTML forms_ chapter. I also continued my new habit of taking some course notes focusing on the concepts covered so I could review them later.

**Thoughts**: Integrating the front end and back end pieces of forms is super cool. This first half was mostly focused on understanding the GET-POST-Redirect pattern along with designing the Register and Login forms.

### Day 9: Monday, February 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I completed the _User input and HTML forms_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: This back half of the chapter was focused on putting the backend pieces together to allow user registration and login, user log out and change the navigational options based on whether a user was logged in or not via the use of cookies.

**Link(s) to work**: [Completed User Input and HTML Forms Chapter](https://github.com/johannesgiorgis/talkpython/tree/171f5a93359f7741607c901f46b9ff8a4518270d/data-driven-web-apps-with-flask)


### Day 10: Wednesday, February 26th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday, I took a day off. Today, I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I worked halfway through the _Client and server-side validation_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: I really like the View Models design pattern that Michael introduces us to in this chapter. I need to revisit this to wrap my head around what an appropriate view model looks like. I did understand the general gist of cleaning up your views to ensure they are kept straight forward without a lot of validation and checking code intermixed with them.

**Link(s) to work**: [Started incorporating View Models](https://github.com/johannesgiorgis/talkpython/tree/0b9046bc997531b95d7f073c5501632714d8fbd7/data-driven-web-apps-with-flask)



### Day 11: Thursday, February 27th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I completed working through the _Client and server-side validation_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: I started to get a deeper understanding of how View Models design pattern works. It is a nice way to organize your code and keep your view methods clean. The habit of taking notes for the concept part of the lectures is very helpful to reinforce these lessons and have an organized notes around them.

### Day 12: Friday, February 28th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I worked on extending the use of view models to the rest of the application as part of the _Client and server-side validation_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: As I extended the use of view models to the rest of the application, I hit a bug that I was unable to resolve. I spent some time debugging and comparing my code with the course code and got nothing. Finally, I created a `working-version` branch based on yesterday's commit and started adding changes there while verifying I could still run the application. Through the process, I was able to fix a couple of issues:

- Fix SQLAlchemy session issues due to session not being closed within the services/ directory files
- Resolved my main issue of breaking the web app - the issue might have been in the `viewmodels/home/index_viewmodel.py` file as I may have been calling functions that didn't expect and passing nonsense to the Jinja template which was complaining.

I will continue to make my changes tomorrow and move to the next chapter on testing tomorrow.

### Day 13: Monday, March 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: The past couple of days I hit a snafu with Github related to hiding my email and ensuring that Github wouldn't allow me to push a commit to expose this private email. I did some work on Saturday before I got sidetracked but decided not to log it as it wasn't really a full hour. I continued my work on Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I extended view models to the rest of the view methods in the application, ensured it was working again via using another branch and now I started working on the next chapter, _Testing Web Apps_.

**Thoughts**: Implementing the rest of the view models helped me further understand how they work. Again, I'd like to build a similar proejct on my own and implement them to ensure I really understand them. They are quite a nice way to further clean and organize your code. I really like that Michael is very organized in his approach to his projects. Getting into the later parts of this course and covering topics such as testing and deployment are very exciting. Writing down the concepts as I go for later review and reinforcement continues to be helpful.

### Day 14: Tuesday, March 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I continued my work on Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I completed the _Testing Web Apps_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: Going through the Michael's approach to test, how he breaks it down into testing the 3 web components we have - view models, views and finally integration testing was great. A lot of the tests end up being pretty simple and easy to understand at a glance. I love the elegance.

### Day 15: Wednesday, March 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I continued my work on Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I completed the _Deployment_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: I attempted to go through this chapter using a Docker approach. However I found the server script Michael used to not work without manual intervention. It looks like it is designed to be run adhocly one by one. So I will work on some modifications over the weekend by setting up a Digital Ocean Droplet as Mike has and deploying my web app there. Over all, it was great learning what it takes to deploy a Python Web App as this was soemthing I didn't fully understanding coming in. Learning how to deploy it by using NGINX with UWSGI was great. I hope to implementing this leearning in a future Python Web App project soon.
