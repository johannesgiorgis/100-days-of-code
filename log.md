Day 1: Monday January 29, 2018
Today's Progress: Worked on EPI - C0 - 11.01 - Search a Sorted Array for first occurence of k
Thoughts: I got the algorithm to work, which uses a modified version of Binary Search to keep looking for the first occurence of a number even if it finds it at a certain index, unlike regular Binary Search which would return it immediately. Could have simplified the code when the desired number is found.

**Today's Progress**: I worked through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap.
