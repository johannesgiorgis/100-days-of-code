# 100 Days Of Data Science - Log 01

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Tuesday, February 11, 2020.

### Day 1: Tuesday, February 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I had jumped through the relevant backend aspects of the course to help me complete an API coding challenge. Now I wanted to go through the rest and build out the PyPI Clone that we build throughout the course.

**Thoughts**: I got to the point where I have a common layout for my two page website - home page and about page. So far, we utilized Flask, HTML, Jinja templates, CSS and JavaScript via Bootstrap.

**Link(s) to work**: [Initial Website with Common Layout](https://github.com/johannesgiorgis/talkpython/tree/21be4881090575df20168e649068b741c4297357/data-driven-web-apps-with-flask/pypi_org)
