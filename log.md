# 100 Days Of Data Science - Log 01

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Tuesday, February 11, 2020.

### Day 1: Tuesday, February 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I had jumped through the relevant backend aspects of the course to help me complete an API coding challenge. Now I wanted to go through the rest and build out the PyPI Clone that we build throughout the course.

**Thoughts**: I got to the point where I have a common layout for my two page website - home page and about page. So far, we utilized Flask, HTML, Jinja templates, CSS and JavaScript via Bootstrap.

**Link(s) to work**: [Initial Website with Common Layout](https://github.com/johannesgiorgis/talkpython/tree/21be4881090575df20168e649068b741c4297357/data-driven-web-apps-with-flask/pypi_org)


### Day 2: Wednesday, February 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I completed the _Jinja2 templates_, _Routing and URLs_, _Bootstrap and frontend CSS framework_ chapters and starting working on the _Adding our design_ chapter. I spent most of my day working through the course so this was more than 1 hour worth of work.

**Thoughts**: Learning about Michael's approach to organizing his code is interesting - he is very organized and has come up with an approach that works well for him. It's great to learn how to structure Flask Apps to allow you to grow them over time instead of the typical stuff you find in most Flask tutorials.

### Day 3: Thursday, February 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working through Talk Python's Building Data Driven Web Applications with Flask, SQLAlchemy & Bootstrap. I completed the _Adding Our Design_ chapter.

**Thoughts**: Front-end and Design work is so not my forte - it took much longer than I expected to get everything working as in the class chapter. But it worked and it was great seeing the processing of going from plain vanilla HTML to a fully designed set of pages.
